# DIY Automations for Startups

This document outlines intricate automation workflows that can be built from scratch to help startups become more agentic. These automations are designed to be implemented using custom scripts, APIs, and open-source tools, without relying on services like N8N.

## Customer Support

*   **AI-Powered Triage:** Automatically categorize and prioritize support tickets using natural language processing (NLP).
*   **Automated Response Generation:** Use a large language model (LLM) to draft responses to common questions, which can be reviewed by a human agent before sending.
*   **Proactive Support:** Monitor user activity and proactively reach out to users who seem to be struggling with a particular feature.

## Marketing & Socials

*   **Personalized Email Campaigns:** an email sequence that is automatically triggered by user behavior (e.g., signing up, using a feature, inactivity).
*   **Social Media Content Curation:** Automatically find and schedule relevant content to post on social media channels.
*   **Competitor Monitoring:** Track competitors' online activity (e.g., blog posts, social media mentions, pricing changes) and send alerts to the marketing team.

## Feature Discovery

*   **User Feedback Analysis:** Automatically analyze user feedback from various sources (e.g., surveys, support tickets, social media) to identify common themes and feature requests.
*   **Usage Pattern Analysis:** Track how users are interacting with the product to identify areas for improvement and new feature opportunities.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** a simple A/B testing framework to test new features and ideas.

## Examples from the Collection

Here is an example of an intricate automation from this collection that can be built without N8N services.

### Automated User Feedback Analysis and Routing

This workflow, inspired by `workflows/0044_Trello_Googlecloudnaturallanguage_Automate_Triggered.json`, automates the process of analyzing and routing user feedback.

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Receive Feedback:** The workflow starts when a user submits a form (e.g., Typeform, Google Forms, or a custom form on your website).
2.  **Analyze Sentiment:** The feedback text is sent to a sentiment analysis service, like Google Cloud Natural Language, to determine if the feedback is positive, negative, or neutral.
3.  **Route Based on Sentiment:**
    *   **Positive Feedback:** If the sentiment is positive, a new page is created in a Notion database to log the positive feedback, and a notification is sent to a team Slack channel to celebrate.
    *   **Negative/Neutral Feedback:** If the sentiment is neutral or negative, a new card is created in a Trello board, assigned to the product team for review.

**DIY Implementation:**

This can be built using a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) or a small web server (e.g., using Flask or Express).

*   **Trigger:** The function would have a public URL to act as a webhook, which would be called by your form provider.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** The function would make an API call to the Google Cloud Natural Language API (or another NLP service) with the feedback text.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The function would have `if/else` statements to check the sentiment score returned by the API.
*   **Actions:** Based on the logic, the function would make API calls to the Notion API, Slack API, and/or Trello API to perform the desired actions.

This automation helps startups to be more agentic by ensuring that all user feedback is processed, analyzed, and directed to the right people automatically, enabling faster responses and better product development.
